# Pandas cheatsheet

### Basic functionality

Foundational element of pandas package is the DataFrame object. The pandas documentation defines as follows:
>Two-dimensional, size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data. Data structure also contains labeled axes (rows and columns). Arithmetic operations align on both row and column labels. Can be thought of as a dict-like container for Series objects. The primary pandas data structure.

2-Dimensional data can be output to a dataframe object by variety of methods, whether manually, from 
a dictionary, series, html, etc. Can also take a variety of args to construct a dataframe according to need. See the [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) for further explanation of all args.
